# Threads

This project creates routines that perform standard queuing functions. 
The functions work on multiple queues, and structure each queue as a doubly linked, circular list.

# Test Case 

Each test case will have two numbers of the form
A,B

Here A is the total number of threads and B is the number of times each thread should be executed.

For example if a test case input is 

2,3

You should output the following


 This is 1 th execution of thread 1 with global var value 1 

 This is 1 th execution of thread 2 with global var value 3 

 This is 2 th execution of thread 1 with global var value 4 

 This is 2 th execution of thread 2 with global var value 6 

 This is 3 th execution of thread 1 with global var value 7 

 This is 3 th execution of thread 2 with global var value 9


To get the output simply use the following code in command line
